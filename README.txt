During this assignment we learnt how the ls command works in the linux/unix system. We were able to see how to list and access files and directories and upon user input we were also able to access information about the file or directory and output it onto the terminal. We learnt about directory handling/accessing , inode,struct dirent , struct stat , data type DIR etc.
The target user input for the program needs to be of the type:
./myls [option] [file/dir]
We were able to imitate the behaviour of the ls command when dealing with options such as -i -l and -R (and their various (7) combinations ).
Also we saw how special paths execute navigation from one directory to another and how inputting 
an option with a special path shows the files/directories at the specified target and outputs then according to the option.

Another feature we would've liked to add myls would be the ability to show directories with a separate color as the ls command of the linux does.
